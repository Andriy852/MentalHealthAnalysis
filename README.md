In this analysis, we're diving deep into the
mental health of people working in the tech industry
over several years. We're looking at surveys from 2014,
2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 to understand mental health 
differences across genders, age groups, types of jobs, 
and company cultures. Our goal is to figure out who 
might be more at risk for mental health issues and 
how different aspects of their work and workplace 
affect them.

## Conclusion

Our exploratory data analysis revealed several key insights:

   * **Prevalence of Mental Health Issues:** A significant portion of respondents reported mental health problems, with variations observed based on gender, age, and job roles.

   * **Gender Differences:** Women and individuals outside the traditional binary genders reported higher percentages of mental health issues compared to men. Different gender groups also showed varying tendencies towards specific disorders.

   * **Age and Mental Health:** Mental health outcomes varied with age, with certain disorders being more prevalent among younger or older age groups.

   * **Job Roles:** Certain professions, such as designers and HR professionals, showed higher prevalence rates of mental disorders. Interestingly, top-level executives and supervisors reported the lowest occurrence.

   * **Company Size and Mental Health Coverage:** Larger companies tended to offer more mental health coverage compared to smaller ones. However, smaller companies showed a higher percentage of healthy employees, possibly indicating a more supportive work environment.

   * **Work Environment:** Remote and office workers showed no significant difference in mental health outcomes, suggesting that work environment may not be a major factor.
